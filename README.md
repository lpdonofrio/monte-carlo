# monte-carlo

Setting: using a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the number of snow leopards in a region using a camera trap.
The goal is to understand what the best estimate for the number of animals roaming the region is, given that
a camera trap at location [3,3] records 5 sightings over 100 days. Assumption: the region is defined by
a 10x10 km grid; the camera can only take one shot per day; the leopard moves from one cell to the next once a day.
